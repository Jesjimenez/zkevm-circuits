# Archiving notice

This repository is archived due to our shift from building a zkEVM by writing custom circuits to developing a general purpose zkVM.  You can read more about our direction shift in our blog: [The next chapter for zkEVM Community Edition](https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/hqLMwLfKmQLj773QCRLTOT-Z8sSUaTEfQpBSdTbitbs).  We don't plan to continue the development and support of the zkEVM repositories at [zkevm-circuits](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits), [zkevm-specs](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-specs) and [zkevm-docs](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-docs).

At the time of archiving this, the followings are some related developments that you might be interested in:
- The zkEVM-CE project was developed in collaboration with Scroll and Taiko.  Scroll is still maintaining and updating their own version which you can find at [scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits).
- If you are looking for a performant Keccak and sha256 circuits implementation, you can find the corresponding circuits originally developed for the zkEVM ready to be used in a halo2 circuit here [axiom-crypto/halo2-lib](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/tree/community-edition/hashes/zkevm) thanks to Axiom who picked them and exposed them in a library.
- We're still maintaining and developing our halo2 fork at [privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2/)
- We're still developing Chiquito at [privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito), a zk circuit DSL that implements many of the patterns found during the development of the zkEVM (mainly circuits described as a state machine).
